    <h1>Why Dogs and Humans Love Each Other More Than Anyone Else</h1>
    <img src="../../img/dogowner.jpg" alt="A dog and its owner">
    <p>The relationship began—well, nobody knows exactly when it began. 
        The earliest remains of humans and dogs interred together date to 14,000 years ago, 
        but there are some unconfirmed finds that are said to be more than twice as old. 
        The larger point is the meaning of the discoveries: we lived with dogs and then chose to be buried with them. 
        Imagine that.
        It was only by the tiniest bit of genetic chance that our cross-species union was forged at all. 
        Dogs and wolves share 99.9% of their mitochondrial DNA—the DNA that’s passed down by the mother alone—which makes 
        the two species nearly indistinguishable. But elsewhere in the genome, there are a few genetic scraps that make a 
        powerful difference. On chromosome six in particular, investigators have found three genes that code for 
        hyper-sociability—and they are in the same spot as similar genes linked to similar sweetness in humans.</p>
    <p>Our ancestors didn’t know what genes were many millennia ago, but they did know that every now and then, 
        one or two of the midsize scavengers with the long muzzles that came nosing around their campfires would 
        gaze at them with a certain attentiveness, a certain loving neediness, and that it was awfully hard to resist them. 
        So they welcomed those few in from the cold and eventually came to call them dogs, while the animals’ 
        close kin that didn’t pull the good genes—the ones we would come to call wolves or jackals or coyotes or 
        dingoes—would be left to make their way in the state of nature in which they were born.</p>
    <p>Today, at least in areas populated by humans, dogs are the planet’s most abundant terrestrial carnivore. 
        There are about 900 million of them worldwide, just shy of 80 million of whom live in the U.S. alone. 
        The single species that is the domestic dog—Canis lupus familiaris—has been subdivided into hundreds of breeds, 
        selected for size or temperament or color or cuteness.
        <br><br>The average American dog owner spends more than $2,000 a year on food, toys, medical care and more, 
        and some people would be prepared to pay a much higher, much dearer price. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans 
        in 2005, so many people refused to evacuate without their dogs that Congress passed a law requiring disaster 
        preparedness plans to make accommodations for pets.       
        <br><br>What began as a mutual-services contract between two very different species became something much more like love. 
        None of that makes a lick of sense, but it doesn’t have to. Love rarely touches the reasoning parts of the brain. 
        It touches the dreamy parts, the devoted parts—it touches the parts we sometimes call the heart. 
        For many thousands of years, it’s there that our dogs have lived.</p>
