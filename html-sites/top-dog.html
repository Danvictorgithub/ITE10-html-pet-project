    <h1>Top 1 - Dog</h1>
    <p>It is no surprise that dog is the most popular pet around
        , they are loyal to their owners. And known to be as "Man's 
        Best friend". Though this is nothing but a result of statistical data.
        It doesn't mean that dog is the "best" pet but rather the common one.
        They are smart, and have keen senses that maybe used for military purposes.
        Dogs are easily trained to do fun tricks like rolling on the ground.
        And they can live long years with love and care.
