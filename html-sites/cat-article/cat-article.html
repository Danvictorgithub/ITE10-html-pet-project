    <title>Foods to avoid for Cats</title>

    <h1>Food to avoid for cats</h1>
    <img src="../../img/catfood.jpg" alt="Cat eating food" width="450">
    <p>Because they're such picky eaters, we sometimes think cats know what’s best for them when it's time to eat.
         But the fact that they'll walk away from a piece of bad meat doesn't mean they'll bypass an open can of tuna.
          And that can of tuna can be just as dangerous.
           In fact, you may be surprised to learn some of the common foods your cats should never eat.</p>
    <h2>Tuna</h2>
    <p>
        Cats can be addicted to tuna, whether it's packed for cats or for humans. Some tuna now and then probably won't hurt. 
        But a steady diet of tuna prepared for humans can lead to malnutrition because it won't have all the nutrients a cat needs. 
        And, too much tuna can cause mercury poisoning. Remember the saying, "Honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach." 
        Your cat will see an open can of tuna next to the sink as a dinner invitation.</p>
    <h2>Raw Eggs, Raw Meat & Bones</h2>
    <p>Just like humans, consumption of raw eggs or raw meat can lead to salmonella or E. coli poisoning in cats. 
        Symptoms of the illness vary but can include vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. 
        Salmonella and E. coli can also be transmitted to humans, 
        so be careful to properly wash your hands after cooking and keep your cat away from these raw foods. 
        Raw eggs also contain an enzyme that can lead to skin and coat problems. 
        Keep your cat from eating raw bones as well—she could choke on them, injure her digestive tract, or damage her teeth.</p>
    <h2>Chocolate and Caffeinated Drinks</h2>
    <p>We’ve all heard that chocolate can be fatal to dogs, but it’s just as poisonous for cats as well. 
        Chocolate contains substances called methylxanthines, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, high body temperature, 
        muscle tremors, abnormal heart rhythm, abdominal discomfort, increased thirst, and seizures. 
        Methylxanthines are also found in caffeinated beverages and should be avoided. 
        See your vet if your cat experiences any of these symptoms. As a general rule of thumb, 
        darker chocolates are more dangerous than milk and white chocolate.</p>
