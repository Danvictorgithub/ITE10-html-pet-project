    <h1>About Cats</h1>
    <p>As a cat owner, having cats provide protection on our household
        on pest like rats, they are very territorial and they don't like
        outsider. Unlike those cats are not good guards against malicious stranger.
        Cat's is easy to take care. They require less food and litter less mostly
        they cover it with dirt.

    <h2>Cat's Life</h1>
    <p>Cats can sanitize themselves but I still advice
        to bath them sometimes with warm water. It takes a lot of time for them to
        get used with water since it makes their fur cold affecting the skin which cause
        panic to the cats, that is why warm water is advisable. Avoid feeding them dairy
        foods since cats are naturally lactose intolerant once they reach adult age which
        means they get sick when drinking milk.</p>
    <p>Cats travel around in their territory, Mostly male cats travel around to find mate.
        Cats is notorious for their reproduction that is why it is advisable to have them
        spayed if you don't want unnecessary responsibilities of raising another kitten.
        Have a known vet do the work to provide safety of your pet.
