    <h1>The Birds</h1>
    <p>Birds are one of the symbol of freedom. They live in the forest
        flying and hunting from various location. They are remained
        untouched by humans. But sometimes other are evolved to coexist
        with our society and living in the cities road to get food. It
        can't be avoided that they might get hunted by humans and stored
        in an isolated cage. Which is very controversial on Human Ethics
        of having birds as pet. But there are great example of people taking
        care of birds as pets.

    <h2>Birds as Pet</h2>
    <p>Having a bird as pet can be controversial, learning from the psychology of
        isolation. Most of the time birds are stuck in the iron cage for the rest of
        their lives and never feel the breeze of the wind and flying with other birds.
        But pet owners are different from those people who isolates birds. As far as
        experience from other people, becoming a bird owner can be seem as accident.
        Birds can gain affection to humans if you feed them repeatedly in daily manners.
        And they gain positive benefits which makes them come again. Some of the bird owners
        I know, build a small birdhouse where bird can rest and sometimes build a nest there.
        They are free to fly and come again, No restriction unlike bird cages.

    <p>As with food, birds are self-nurturing pets they travel on their own to find their own food
        still you can feed them if you wanted. Depending on the bird species they can have 
        lots of intelligence and can be trained. Birds have short lifespan and living in the fullest.
